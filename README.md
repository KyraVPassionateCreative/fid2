# fid2
This repository was created the class DIG2500C (Fundamentals of Interactive Design). I took this class last term but unfortunately due to personal family circumstances I wasn't able to keep up with the class. Hence, my repository being fid2. Although this is my second attempt at this class I am still excited to properly learn all the criteria within each assignment we are going to be doing this summer.
