    This is barely a "recipe" since I just threw it together and didn't pay much attention to measurements. But it turned out to be pretty tasty, so I thought I'd share. It's not the kind of thing where exact measurements are that crucial anyway, so use your best judgment and personal taste.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

<img src="/blackgoose/jenskitchen/images/couscous.png" alt="couscous ingredient images for reference">

<ul>
  <li>
    1 package of couscous
  </li>
  <li>
    1 can chicken broth <em>(or water or veggie broth if you are vegetarian)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    1 to 1/2 cups fresh peas, shelled
  </li>
  <li>
    3-4 scallions, sliced thin
  </li>
  <li>
    1/4 cups toasted pine nuts
  </li>
  <li>
    about 1/2 cup fresh mint, chopped <em>(it's gotta be fresh, not dried)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    approximately 1/4 cup of olive oil <em>(or to taste)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    1 t. salt
  </li>
  <li>
    fresh ground pepper to taste
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step By Step Directions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Make a whole box of couscous according to the directioms, only use chicken broth instead of water. A typical can of broth will be just short of the amount of liquid it calls for on the box, so top it off with water. It will be done in 6 or 7 minutes. Allow to cool <em>(putting it in the fridge speeds up the process 10/10 highly recommend to save some time)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Meanwhile, toss the shelled fresh peas into a pot of boiling water and cook them about 3 minutes, until bright green and tender, but not mushy. Test after 2 minutes to make sure they're not overcooked. Rinse in cold water and allow to cool.
  </li>
  <li>
    Slice the scallions, chop the mint, toast the pinenuts, and prepare any other veggies you want to toss in there.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make the dressing in a small bowl by whisking together the juice of a lemon, the salt, pepper, and enough olive oil to properly balance the acidity of the lemon juice. It will take approximately 1/4 cup of olive oil, maybe a little more. Remember that this dressing has to flavor many cups of bland and absorbant couscous, so make sure you have enough and make sure the flavor is bold <em>(don't be afraid of the salt - it will get spread out)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    When the couscous is cool, toss in the peas, mint, veggies and coat with the dressing. It can be served right away or saved until the next day.

  <small>Chef Note: T. stands for Table Spoon, t. stands for teaspoon. c. is for cup, and lbs for pounds. I am the type of person that tends to forget these things so I thought it would be nice just to leave this little note here. Hope you enjoy the recipe. Let me know how it goes and how you like it.</small>
