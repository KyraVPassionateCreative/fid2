  <h1>Linguine with Clam Sauce<h1>

    <p>I don't know how authentic this recipe is, but it's quick and delicious. You can make it lactose-free by substituting a dairy-free margarine <em>(we like Earth's balance)</em> for the butter. <em>(Unfortunately, butter is better yet so unhealthy)</em> This recipe is enough to serve 2 people.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>2 cans chopped claims <em>(tuna-sized cans)</em></li>
      <li>1/2 head of garlic, chopped fine</li>
      <li>1 shallot, chopped fine</li>
      <li>2-3 T. butter <em>(or margarine)</em></li>
      <li>1/2 - 3/4 c. dry white wine <em>(like Sauvignon Blanc)</em></li>
      <li>1/2 lb. of linguine pasta noodles</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>Get the water boiling for the linguine. Generously salt the water so the pasta has flavor of its own.</li>
      <li>Open the cans of clams and use the lid to squeeze out the liquid into a 2-cup measuring cup. Set the claims aside. <em>You usually get about 1 1/2 cups of liquid.</em></li>
      <li>In a high-sided, large skillet, saute the shallot in 2 T. butter until translucent. Add the garlic <em>(the more the better)</em> and saute until fragrant, but not brown <em>(just under a minute should do the trick)</em></li>
      <li>
        Add the clam juice and wine to the shallots and farlic. Turn the heat to medium high until the mixture boils. Continue boiling until the liquid has reduced by half.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn down the heat and add the reserved clams. At roughly the same time, add the pasta to the water and cook until <em>al dente</em>. About 9 minutes later, the pasta should be done and the clams will be warmed through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste the clam sauce and add salt and pepper to taste. If you're using butter, add one last tablespoon or two to bind the sauce <em>(if you're using margarine, don't bother)</em>.
      </li>
    </ol>

<p><small>Chef Note: T. stands for Table Spoon, t. stands for teaspoon. c. is for cup, and lbs for pounds. I am the type of person that tends to forget these things so I thought it would be nice just to leave this little note here. Hope you enjoy the recipe. Let me know how it goes and how you like it.</small></p>
