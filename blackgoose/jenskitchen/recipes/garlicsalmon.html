    <p>This is one of my favorite recipes for when folks come over for dinner. I've already shared this popular recipe with many of my friends. The best thing is it's <em>so easy</em> to make!</p>

    <ul>
      <li>1/4 c. dry sherry</li>
      <li>2 T. soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 T. vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 t. dry mustard</li>
      <li>3-4 T. freshly minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 to 2 lbs of salmon filets</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>Mix together first 5 ingredients in a shallow dish. Place the cleaned and de-boned salmon filets face down in the mixture and allow to marinate for 1/2 to 1 hour. <em>(Tip, I cut a large piece of salmon into the serving sizes before marinating so the marinade can coat the sides of each piece as well.)</em></li>
      <li>Preheat the broiler. Transfer filets to a baking sheet, skin-down. Broil the salmon on the top rack for 7 to 9 minutes, or until done to your liking/preference <em>(I like it still pink in the center.)</em></li>
      <li>I usually serve this with an aromatic rice and a lightly seasoned stir fry.</li>
    </ol>

<p><small>Chef Note: T. stands for Table Spoon, t. stands for teaspoon. c. is for cup, and lbs for pounds. I am the type of person that tends to forget these things so I thought it would be nice just to leave this little note here. Hope you enjoy the recipe. Let me know how it goes and how you like it.</small></p>
