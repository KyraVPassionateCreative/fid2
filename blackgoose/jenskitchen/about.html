    <h2>Hello and Welcome Everyone!</h2>

    <p>The recipes listed here are ones that I have developed myself. In some case, I started with a recipe found in a cookbooks or magazine, but over time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own. <em>Bon Appetit!</em></p>

    <p>The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources. One day, I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews.</p>

    <p>If you have recommendations, feel free to email me at jen@example.com I would absolutely love to hear from you.</p>
